Code I have written while learning C#

Test and Test2 are just random tests I have performed.

Calculator : Choose math operation (add, subtract, multiply or divide), then add two int values.

Fibonacci : Add how many times you wish the fibonacci chain to run. eg: "10".

VirusScan : String answer = scan || hide --> scan || unhide --> game over(Exit application)

FunctionCaller : Write a string and the application will sort the string into the right function based on the first character. 
Not case sensitive.
